# Chessboard

This is an application made in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) that takes the position of a Knight as input via mouseclick on a **8x8** chessboard.

Given the position of the Knight, the application finds all the possible places where the Knight can move.
